#Quick intro
The first series of posts here will be about my first steps in the world of
modular synths. I've been into music and computers for more than twenty years
but I have never owned or even touched a real modular synth. As an electronics
engineer and musician interested in electronic music I find that very odd.
Luckily it's easy to fix.


#First (baby) step
Today I ordered a [CVPal] DIY-kit from Mutable Instruments. I've figured out that since I make most of my music with the aid of computers (Ableton Live) it's the most logical step.
