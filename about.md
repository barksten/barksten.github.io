My name is Anders Östlin and I live in Gävle, Sweden.
I work as a software developer at [Lantmäteriet] but this is my private space and you will only find my personal projects and opinions.
I will try to collect some of my hoppy projects here so you will most likely find something about my main hobbies:

* Music making
* Cocoa Programming (AU-units)
* Mountainbiking

I have a billion of other interests but I will not spend time writing them all down.

My [first post] will be about my brand new hobby: Modular synths


If you want to get in touch with me you have some links in the footer.
